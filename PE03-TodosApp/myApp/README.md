Input

The "todos" app lets users type tasks into a text box. A "Submit" button adds the task as a new todo item. The app has a tab bar at the bottom with three choices—All, Active, and Complete—so users can choose which todos to see.

Process

When a user types a task and clicks "Submit," the app saves the task in a list and shows the list in the console. Each todo has a name and a status to show if it’s done or not. The "Done" button changes the status of a todo, and the "Delete" button removes it. The tab bar changes the list to show only the todos that match the chosen tab, using React Native to update the screen.

Output

The app shows a list of todos with their names and buttons. The tab bar at the bottom highlights the chosen filter, and the console shows the todo list for checking.
