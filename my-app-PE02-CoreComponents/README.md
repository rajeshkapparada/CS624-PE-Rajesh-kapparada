# Input
The user opens the app on their phone. They see a box where they can type the name of their favorite course. The app also loads a list of
MSCS courses automatically. The user types their favorite course into the box.

# Process
The app saves what the user types using a small piece of memory called state. It is built using basic tools from React Native like View,
Text, ScrollView, Image, TextInput, and StyleSheet. The course list is put inside a scrollable area so the user can swipe up and down to
see all the courses. Some simple styles are added to make the screen look nice and easy to read.

# Output
The app shows a message with the userâ€™s favorite course on the screen. It also shows a scrollable list of courses grouped into core,
depth of study, and capstone. An image appears at the top to make the app look more complete. The screen looks clean, simple, and easy to
use on any phone.
