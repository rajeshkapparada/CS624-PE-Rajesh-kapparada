# Input

The input for this program is hardcoded data about users: their name, job title, and short description. There are no external user inputs.

# Process

In Part 1, the app shows a profile card with text styled using the techniques from Section 4.3 of the textbook. The styles include font sizes, colors, spacing, and alignment.

In Part 2, the app displays a grid of 6 profile cards. This is done using flexbox layout (from Section 5.3). Each card appears as a thumbnail. When the user taps on a card, it expands to show full details. This requires managing state to track which card is expanded.

# Output

The output is a mobile app screen:
- In Part 1, it shows a single styled profile card.
- In Part 2, it shows six cards in a responsive grid layout with expand/collapse features. Screenshots are saved in the PE04 folder.
