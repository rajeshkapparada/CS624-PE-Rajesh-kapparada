Input
The application does not require any user input.
It runs automatically upon launch without any interaction.
All displayed information is hardcoded into the app.

Process
The app begins by creating a main view using React Native.
It includes three text elements to show the developer’s name, degree program, and school.
A StyleSheet is used to apply a yellow background and align the content neatly.

Output
Once opened, the app displays the developer’s details in the center of the screen.
The background is a solid yellow, making the text stand out clearly.
The final layout is simple and meets the design requirements.
