# Input
Users can enter a city name along with the country it belongs to. They can also provide a country name and the currency used in that country. The app checks each input to ensure that only letters and spaces are entered, helping maintain clean and valid data.

# Process
The app uses tab navigation with two main tabs: one for viewing the list of countries and another for adding a new country. Within the Countries tab, stack navigation is used to move from the list of countries to a detailed view. When a user taps on a country, it opens a screen showing more information, including the currency used.

# Output
The main screen displays a list of all the countries that have been added. When a user taps on a country, a new screen opens showing its name and the currency it uses. The interface is clean, user-friendly, and designed with simple, readable components for a smooth experience.
